# Basic_C-_Programs
These are some small projects I completed using C# and the .Net Frameowrk

- Car Insurance Project
The Car Insurance Project was one of the bigger/most important projects I completed on this course. It is a MVC web application that mimicks a car insurance website. It takes the users input and calculates a quote.

Learning C# has been one of the most challenging, fun, rewarding things I've done on this boot camp so far. As you can see with a lot of my smaller projects at the beginning, to some of the bigger projects at the end,
my C# skills continue to grow on a daily basis.
